For anyone wondering: This is the repo for my master thesis. I wanted to make it a pip-installable package, but the time was limited and I had to focus on the written thesis and therefore never published it.

CCREx is a module for predicting hendecad coiled-coil domains on protein sequences utilizing regular expressions and CNN models.

Currently it requires ```python=3.9```

## Installation

You can install the module using pip:

```bash
Won't happen :(
```

## Theoretical Usage
```bash
ccrex -i path/to/fasta [-o /output/directory/ ] [-p/--plot True/False]
```
